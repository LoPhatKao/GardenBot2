GardenBot, by tynaut.

To install, put the /GardenBot folder in your Starbound/mods folder.

See the mod page at http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/gardenbot.1690/ for up to date information on this mod and compatibility with other mods.

Need your custom crop to be compatible with GardenBot?
Check the Templates/objects/farmables/customseed/customseed.object file for an example. Replace "customseed" with your farmable name, or modify the custom seed to include the script located in the template.
If you are running JTEs Persistant Farmables, it is advides you skip this, and just make the seed compatible with that mod. GardenBot will automatically work with any crop that is compatible with Persistant Farmables.
